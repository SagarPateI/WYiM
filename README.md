# 📜 Premise:

You play as a court jester. Your mime partner has run away from the castle, since the King threw a tomato at them during their latest performance. The castle has gone on lockdown, to prevent anyone else from escaping. In order to rejoin them and renounce your castle life, you need to escape the castle by navigating through guards, intent on stopping you. You can throw pies at the guards and enemies that will prevent them from shooting further projectiles at you. However, there is a limit on how many pies you can have per level, so you need to be clever with how you use them. The enemies can be mobile or stationary. Mobile enemies don’t have unlimited range or much motion and move in set patterns. A level is beat when you successfully make it out of a room or area without losing all three hearts. There will be more than one level for you to play through in order to find Mime and rejoin your love.

# 🕹️ Mechanics:
 <ol type="1">
    <li>Three hearts represent lives. Depending on difficulty of level/enemy, half a life or a full life will be removed
        when the player character gets hit by a bullet or projectile. For example, in the first level, a full life gets removed once the player is hit. In the second and third levels, a half life is removed once the player is hit.</li>
    <li>Single location on the map. The castle has three levels.</li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Each level will have increasing difficulty, with the first one being the easiest and the last one being the
            hardest.</li>
        <li>Difficulty will be increased by more enemies and more difficult patterns.</li>
        <ol type="i">
        </ol>
        <li>Pies will generally be 2/3 of the number of enemies and stay fixed relative to the
            enemy count. Pies will not carry over from one level to the next. Each level starts with a fresh number of pies.</li>
	<li>There will be pie ammo stacks in levels, so that players can get more pies, if they run out early.</li>
        <li>Player uses the WASD keys to move around and dodge the projectiles.</li>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>The player clicks and holds the mouse to aim, and releases when the cursor is inside the circle.</li>
            <li>If the player misses the enemy they are aiming at, they lose the pie, and the pie has zero effect.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>The level is beat when the player successfully manages to get through all of the projectiles and enemies and
            makes it to the level exit, without losing all three hearts.</li>
        <ol type="i">
        </ol>
    </ol>
    <li>Polish items can include a dash function, powerups, and/or level timers for added difficulty. Several of these features are added, and they will appear in the final game.</li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Dash function can help Jester move around level faster and dodge projectiles easier. It is a temp dash,
            where when the key is pressed, Jester moves faster up to 1.5- or 2-times original speed for a short time
        </li>
        <li>Powerups would be randomly generated on levels. Jester could pick one up, by avoiding projectiles to move to
            the location where the pickup shows up. Powerups would give an advantage for a limited time, like ~ 5
            seconds.</li>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Plus 10 seconds to a timer, if timer functionality is included in levels.</li>
            <li>Shield powerup, where if Jester gets hit, the projectiles break the shield first, before harming Jester.
                The shield can take 3-5 hits before it breaks completely, and on the next hit, Jester takes damage.</li>
            <li>Heart powerup to add one heart to the number of hearts Jester has. Doesn’t work to add extra life if
                Jester already has full hearts (3 hearts).</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Level timers would start off with more time on the easier levels. The timer would add a little more
            difficulty, since the player has to navigate through the projectiles in less time than the timer, so there
            are two conditions to meet to move on to the next level, instead of just one. For example, the very first
            easiest level could be on a timer for 0:45 and then the last level could be 1:00.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>For harder levels, a pie bomb might be added, to disable multiple enemies at once.</li>
    <li>If there is enough time, a second location could be added, or simply more levels added to the single location.
    </li>
</ol>
